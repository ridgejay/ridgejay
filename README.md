### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Frontend Developer at Bitovi.  When I am not coding, I work on and update technical articles pertaining to Typescript and Angular.  I also create blog posts and share them with the Devto community.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Typescript, Javascript, Angular material
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NgRx
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any and every project that will be presented to me
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development in general
